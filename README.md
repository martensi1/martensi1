# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm a self-taught software developer from Sweden, always
eager to dive into new technologies and try
new things. I'm passionate about pushing myself
into unknown territory and challenging myself
to grow. Whether it's building web applications,
computer vision projects or diving into 
writing operating systems from scratch (wich I
must say is a very humbling experience). 
I'm always up for a challange!
